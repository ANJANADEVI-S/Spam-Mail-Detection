# Spam-Mail-Detection

This project uses machine learning to classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam). It leverages a labeled dataset (spam.csv) and applies text preprocessing, vectorization using CountVectorizer, and multiple ML models — including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

The best-performing model (Naive Bayes) achieves high accuracy in detecting spam messages. The project includes:

A Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluation (EMAIL_SPAM_DETECTION.ipynb)

A Flask web app (app.py) for real-time predictions

Saved model and vectorizer files (.pkl)

The dataset and supporting scripts
